# Desktop-Assistant
A desktop assistant that tells the time, weather, and can set alarms using html, css, and javascript.

Note: This code is run on a raspberry that sits on a desk with a small screen so it may not work on larger screens. Also, in order for it to run on a raspberry pi it may require a heatsink and fan so the requests to the weather API are reliable.
